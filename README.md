# Task2-Dashboard_Using_Power_Bi
Task Day 2 of my Power BI practice journey, I created a dashboard based on a Superstore Sales dataset. The goal was to explore sales performance across various regions, categories, and customer segments, and to gain meaningful insights into how discounting affects profit. The visualizations I created included:

KPI CARDS shows QUANTITY, TOTAL PROFIT, TOTAL SALES along with LINE CHART.

FILLED MAP shows SALES BY STATE.

Different BAR CHART for TOP CUSTOMERS BY SALES, SUM OF SALES BY SHOPPING TIME, NO OF ORDERS BY SHIP MODE.

DONUT CHART shows TOTAL SALES AND PROFIT BY CATEGORY.
 Visualizations Used:
Bar/Column Charts: Sales and profit by category/sub-category.
Map Visualization: Sales by region or state (geo-analysis).
Line/Area Charts: Trend analysis over months/years.
Pie/Donut Charts: Share of category/sub-category sales.
Tables & Matrix: Detailed sales data (e.g., by product or customer).

 Data Segmentation & Filtering:
Region-wise performance (East, West, Central, South)
Category/Sub-Category Analysis (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
Top N Products or Customers by Sales
Date filtering (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly)

KEY INSIGHTS
The Technology category generated high sales but also had inconsistent profit margins.
Western and Central regions were the top contributors to total sales
